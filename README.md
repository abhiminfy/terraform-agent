# Terraform EC2 and RDS Deployment

This Terraform project deploys a t2.micro EC2 instance running Ubuntu in the us-east-1 region along with a MySQL RDS instance in the same region.

## Overview

This project provisions the following resources:

* **EC2 Instance:** A t2.micro instance running an Ubuntu AMI in the us-east-1 region.
* **RDS Instance:** A MySQL RDS instance in the us-east-1 region.  (Specific RDS instance details like size, storage, etc., are configurable within the Terraform variables.)


## Terraform Requirements

* **Terraform:** Version 0.13+ (recommended latest version)
* **AWS CLI:** Configured with appropriate credentials for accessing the AWS account where the resources will be deployed.

## How to Deploy

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repository-name>.git  # Replace with your repo details
cd <your-repository-name>
```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

```bash
terraform init
```

3. **Review the Execution Plan:**  This step allows you to preview the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

```bash
terraform plan
```

4. **Apply the Changes:**  This step deploys the infrastructure.

```bash
terraform apply
```

You will be prompted to confirm the deployment. Type `yes` and press Enter to proceed.


## Estimated Cost

The estimated monthly cost for running this infrastructure is approximately **$20.59**. This is an estimate and actual costs may vary.  Ensure you destroy the infrastructure using `terraform destroy` when you are finished with it to avoid ongoing charges.


## Inputs/Variables

This project uses variables defined in `variables.tf`  You can customize the deployment by modifying these variables. The key variables include:

* `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy to. Defaults to `us-east-1`.
* `instance_type`: The EC2 instance type. Defaults to `t2.micro`.
* `rds_instance_class`:  The RDS instance class (e.g. `db.t2.micro`).
*  ... other RDS variables (username, password, allocated storage, etc.) as needed.


## Outputs

Upon successful deployment, Terraform will output the following:

* `ec2_public_ip`: The public IP address of the EC2 instance.
* `rds_endpoint`: The endpoint of the RDS instance.


## Destruction

To destroy the infrastructure created by this project, run the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
