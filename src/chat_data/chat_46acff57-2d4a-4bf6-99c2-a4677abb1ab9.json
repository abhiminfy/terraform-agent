The server should be able to access internet so make sure the security group has those enable as required. \nthe ec2 should be able to access data in s3 bucket called 'datainfo'. \nI also neeed a RDS datbase (can be a small instance) The ec2 server should should be able to query this RDS datbase. Make sure the RDS is also in the same VPC.",

To clarify the AWS services needed, are you planning to use RDS for the database and are there any other AWS services required besides S3 and RDS (e.g., EC2, Lambda, etc.)?\n2.  Regarding instance sizing for RDS, given the 5000 products and 12 columns with a 400ms response time target, are you considering a specific RDS instance type/size, or would you like recommendations based on these requirements?  Also, is there a specific storage type you'd prefer (e.g., gp2, io1, gp3)?\n3.  Is this for a production environment or a development/testing environment?",
