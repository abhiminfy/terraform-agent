This includes creating infrastructure configurations for various providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP), incorporating security best practices into that code, and answering your general questions about Terraform concepts and usage.  I can also help you troubleshoot existing Terraform code or suggest improvements.  While I strive to be helpful with any Terraform-related task, I'm not a substitute for thorough testing and validation in a real environment.",
