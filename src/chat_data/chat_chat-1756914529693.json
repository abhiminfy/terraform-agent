      "content": "I don't have a fixed message size limit in the traditional sense.  However, extremely large prompts can impact performance and response quality.  For very large infrastructure deployments, it's best practice to break them down into smaller, modular Terraform configurations. This improves readability, maintainability, and allows for parallel deployments.  If you have a large or complex request, consider describing the desired outcome and architecture first, and we can work together to break it down into manageable chunks.  This will be more efficient than pasting a massive configuration file all at once.",

Since your initial message contained both a greeting and a question, I focused on providing a helpful answer to the question about message size.  I hope this clarifies things!",
