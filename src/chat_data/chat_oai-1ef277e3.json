Are you using a command like `terraform apply` in a terminal, running a script, or using a specific IDE or platform?\n\nGenerally, when you run `terraform apply`, the changes to your infrastructure are applied, but the code itself isn't \"generated\" in a new location. The code you write in your `.tf` files *is* the code that Terraform uses.  If you're expecting to see the output of what Terraform *will* do before applying the changes, you should use `terraform plan`. This command will show you the planned changes without actually applying them.  The output of `terraform plan` will be displayed in your terminal.",
