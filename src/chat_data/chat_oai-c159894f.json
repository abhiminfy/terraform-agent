This includes creating infrastructure configurations for various providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP), incorporating security best practices into that code, and answering your general questions about Terraform concepts and usage.  I can also help you troubleshoot existing Terraform code or suggest improvements.  While I strive to be helpful with any Terraform-related task, I'm not a substitute for thorough testing and validation in a real environment.\nUSER: Can you show me an example of creating an EC2 instance with Terraform?\nASSISTANT: ✅ Terraform code generated successfully.\n\n### Terraform (HCL)\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n ami                    = \"ami-0c55b31ad2299a701\"\n instance_type          = \"t2.micro\"\n key_name               = \"my-key-pair\"\n}\n```\n\n### What I did next\n- Saved to `main.tf`\n- You can run `terraform init && terraform validate`\n</chat_history>",
