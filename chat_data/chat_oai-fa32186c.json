Please analyze the code and provide a corrected, production-ready version.\nFocus on:\n1.  Removing redundant or standalone resources that conflict with the auto-scaling group.\n2.  Replacing hard-coded values (AMI, subnets, account ID) with variables or data sources.\n3.  Replacing the outdated Launch Configuration with a modern Launch Template.\n4.  Fixing the syntax for the AWS Budget resource.\n5.  Adding a CloudWatch alarm to trigger the auto-scaling policy based on CPU utilization.\n6.  Using spot instances within the auto-scaling group for cost savings, not as a separate resource.\nHere is the original code:\n[PASTE THE AGENT'S CODE HERE]",
