Pay special attention to:\n1.  **Critical Bug:** The CloudWatch alarm uses an invalid reference `aws_autoscaling_group.default.instances[0].id`. This will fail. How should an alarm monitor an Auto Scaling Group's CPU?\n2.  **Missing Requirement:** The launch template is not configured for Spot Instances, which was a key cost-saving requirement.\n3.  **Syntax Error:** The structure of the `aws_budgets_budget` resource's notification block looks incorrect for the modern AWS provider.\n4.  **Best Practice:** Is using both `availability_zones` and `vpc_zone_identifier` in the ASG necessary?\nPlease provide the corrected code.",
